# FinanceTracker Java Application

A command-line Java application designed to help users manage their personal finances by tracking incomes, expenses, and financial goals using object-oriented programming principles.

## Project Overview

FinanceTracker offers a straightforward console interface where multiple users can securely register, log in, and manage their financial transactions. The application supports categorizing expenses and incomes, maintaining transaction records, and generating financial summaries. This tool demonstrates practical Java concepts including modular design, data validation, and transaction handling.

## Key Functionalities

- Create and manage multiple user accounts with login authentication
- Record and organize financial transactions including incomes and expenses
- Edit or delete past transactions for data accuracy
- Categorize transactions to better track spending habits
- Generate concise reports showing overall income, expenses, and net balance
- Export recorded data to CSV files for external review
- Robust input validation and exception handling to enhance user experience
- Optionally extendable to support database integration for data persistence

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 or higher
- An IDE or text editor such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for development
- (Optional) Database setup if persistent storage is desired in future versions

## How to Set Up and Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/shanmughapriya200410/financetracker.java.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder.
3. Compile the source files using the Java compiler.
4. Execute the main application class to start the finance tracker.

## Typical Usage Flow

- Register as a new user or sign in with existing credentials.
- Add new income or expense records by entering the required details.
- Modify or remove existing transactions when needed.
- View financial summaries to monitor income and expense trends.
- Export your transaction history as CSV files for backup or analysis.

## Testing and Validation

The application encourages thorough testing of each feature to ensure correctness. Unit tests can be added with frameworks like JUnit to automate validation of core modules such as user management and transaction operations.

## Future Development Plans

- Incorporate database integration (e.g., via JDBC) to maintain transaction data persistently.
- Develop a graphical user interface using JavaFX to improve usability.
- Implement multi-factor authentication for enhanced account security.
- Create mobile or web versions for easier access and synchronization across devices.

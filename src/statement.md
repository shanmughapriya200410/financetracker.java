# Student Management System

## Problem statement  
Managing student, teacher, and admin data in educational institutions is often scattered across multiple disconnected files or formats, leading to redundancy, inconsistencies, and difficulty in maintenance. Manual handling or simplistic systems fail to adequately support efficient updates, role-based access, and timely generation of reports, especially as data volume grows. There is a need for a modular, multi-role system that simplifies CRUD operations and enables concurrent report generation.

## Scope of the project  
This project simulates a student management environment in a Java console application covering full management of Students, Teachers, and Admins. It demonstrates core object-oriented concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism, implements multi-threading for asynchronous report generation, and features a menu-driven interface for ease of use. The project scope includes role management, CRUD functionalities, and report generation but excludes persistent storage or GUI enhancements.

## Target users  
- Educational institution administrators  
- Teachers who need to manage student data and reports  
- Students whose data is maintained and viewed by authorized users  
- Developers and learners seeking a Java OOP project example with concurrency  

## High-level features  
- Add, view, update, and delete records for Students, Teachers, and Admins  
- Base `Person` class with polymorphic handling of different user roles  
- Multi-threaded report generation demonstrating Java concurrency  
- Console-based menu-driven user interface for straightforward navigation  
- Modular code structure with separate classes and packages for maintainability
